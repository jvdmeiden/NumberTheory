	  <h1>Integers</h1>
      <p>Integers, or whole numbers (like 1, 2, 3, .. 13, 14, .. etc.) have 
        puzzled man since prehistoric times. 
        For instance the fact that some numbers like 6 (=1+2+3) and 28 
        (=1+2+4+7+14) are the sum of their divisors has fascinated early Greek 
        mathematicians.
        Until a few decades ago number theory was a relatively 'useless' area of
        mathematics, but today number theory is at the core of our cryptographic
        systems that secure transactions over the internet.
        Here I will illustrate some properties part of these concepts using 
        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 
        SVG is a family of specifications of an open standard by the World Wide 
        Web Consortium for describing two-dimensional static and dynamic 
        graphics.
        Graphs on these pages are generated in flight by your own browser.

      <h1>Divisors</h1><br/>
      <p>
		Divisibility is an interesting property of integers. A number 'N' has non-trivial divisors if there is 
        another number 'M' so that M*X=N. Nontrivial means M is not equal to 1 or N itself (or -1 or -N ...).
        <br/>
        The so called 'prime' numbers have -n-o- nontrivial divisors. If we exclude 1 from the prime numbers (which is the common 
        but arbitrary definition) they are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ... Lots of questions: is there an end to primes? 
        <br/>
        They raise numerous interesting questions: how many prime numbers are there? Some primes differ only by 2 ('twin primes') 
        like 5 and 7, 11 and 13, ... , 41 and 43 etc. How many of these pairs -called 'twin primes'- are there?
        <br/>
        We start off plotting N on an X-axis and on the y-axis the divisors N, 
        this displays a beautifull pattern. In this case we include the trivial 
        divisors: N itself and 1. In the 'millimeter paper' the most left down 
        square has coordinates x=1 and y=1.<br/>

          enabled browser</a>
        </object>
		<br/>
          This pattern keeps repeating itself if we 'travel' to the right. This is beatifully illustrated at <a href="http://www.divisorplot.com/">divisorplot.com</a>.
